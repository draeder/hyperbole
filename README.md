# Hyperbole
Serverless peer-to-peer messaging for browsers

Demo available at https://hyperbole.peer.ooo

This repo ships with a simple express server to serve up `index.html` which has all of the goodies. No server is required to run hyperbole, but a tracker/signaling server is used to initially establish connections between peers.
